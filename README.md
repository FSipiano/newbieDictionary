**I want to make this Open Source (definition in the dictionary!) to enable us all to add and learn from each other!
I want YOU to contribute. Click 'fork repository' (in the three dots button), make your additions in this 'own version', and then create a pull request (definition below) to put it back into this main version! I'll review it and then add it in** üòÑ


I have been thinking about making this for some time, but I wanted to make sure that I had enough knowledge about random tech words before I started... 

 

A code/tech dictionary! 

 

Sometimes, (well for me at least) it very much seems that this industry has overcomplicated words and phrases for things _on purpose._ 

You may be learning from someone who has been in the industry for a while, and for them, these words _just make sense_ 

But do they make sense to you, as a newbie? 

Absolutely not 

I have tried to gather a few words/phrases and definitions together here to help you out, and we can add to it as we go along!! 

There are sometimes multiple words for the same thing, again - just to be confusing. I‚Äôve tried to include all definitions that I‚Äôve heard, but please let me know if I‚Äôve missed any!

**Dynamic site**
A site where what the user experiences changes when they input data, like a comment on a blog or a login to their online account.

**Refactor** - means to look over and rewrite your code in a different way. Maybe you learned a better way to do it, so you rewrite it. 

_‚ÄùI‚Äôm going to spend today refactoring old code because I learned so much since I first wrote it!‚Äù_ 

 

**Directory** - Another word for folder. 

_‚ÄùNavigate to the correct directory‚Äù_ = go to the right folder.  

 

**Local/locally** - On your computer 

_‚ÄúYou can access it locally‚Äù_ 

 

**Remote** - Not on your computer ‚Äì stored on someone else's machine/server Usually means you need to log in, through a portal or ‚Ä¶... to be able to access it. 

_‚ÄúWe need to access this remotely, do you have your login details?‚Äù_ 

 

**Boilerplate** (code) - The standard code you need to put into your code in order for it to run. An example is frameworks. Let‚Äôs take Bootstrap as an example. To use it, you need to copy and paste in a bunch of code that you get from the official website in order for you to be able to use it. Like a template. 

**PR** - stands for 'pull request'. Means that you are requesting that the changes or edits you have made be reviewed and eventually merged (in **git**)

**PR** - also a marketing term meaning 'Press release'. Means anything going out to be published into the wide world for others to see. You could create a PR for a PR I suppose...

**Terminal** or **CLI** - The place where you type commands directly to the computer. You don‚Äôt need this at the beginning, but at least you know what it is.... It looks like a small word document but is black and makes you feel like a hacker. Some people get really excited about it. CLI stands for ‚ÄòCommand Line Interface‚Äô. 

**CLI** - Can also stand for Common Language Infrastructure. A tool, developed by Microsoft, to allow different languages to be understood and interpreted by different computer programs, rather than having to restructure the architecture and build behind it. 

**Text editor** - Somewhere that you can write code. Microsoft Word is a text editor. Notepad is a text editor. It is pretty much just somewhere that you can hit the keyboard and stuff appears... 

 ##If you need something to do more than that, you need üëáüèª 

An **IDE** - Stands for ‚ÄòIntegrated Development Environment‚Äô. It is somewhere that you write code, and has tools to help you write, structure and test it. Build, test, connect to databases, the works! 

**Environment** - where you are working within your computer. For example, if you are making a webpage, your environment would be a **text editor** or **IDE** and the browser window. 

**Version Control** or **Source Control** - A system for managing changes and edits made to a document. Popular version control systems (VCS) include Git and Subversion (SVN).

**Git** - The name of a version control system. Involves branches and trees, pushing and pulling. All in all a great time. 

**GitHub** - The name of a hosting service for storing and interacting with git repositories. GitHub provides additional collaboration tools on top of git, such as Pull Requests, Issues/bug reports, wiki, and other features. Other popular git hosting services include BitBucket and GitLab.

**Objects** - In code, you can create an ‚Äòobject‚Äô that you can refer to later, for example you can create a ‚Äòperson‚Äô with a first name and last name, an age, and an eye colour. This can then be used again if you wanted to create another ‚Äòperson‚Äô 

``var person = {firstName:"Faye", lastName:"Sipiano", age:27, eyeColor:"blue"};`` 

**NaN** - Stands for 'Not a Number'. Is a number.

**Destructuring** - This means to unpack values in a data structure such as an Object or Array.  

**Method** -  

**Function** -  

**JSON** - JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is a common data format (a way data is written), originally derived from JavaScript, many programming languages now have the ability to use JSON. JSON data types include: number, string, boolean, array, object, or null. Basic JSON might look like this:  

```json
{ 
    "firstName": "Faye", 
    "lastName": "Sipiano", 
    "age": 27, 
    "eyeColor": "blue", 
}
```
 
**The DOM** - Always in capitals like that. A place in the browser to see a page‚Äôs HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all working together like a happy little family. You can type in it and add stuff. Useful when making a website and you want something to look a particular way. 

 

**Manipulating the DOM** - Just means changing something (usually JavaScript) in the DOM. 

 
**Repository** - A house for your code, stored online. Repositories are collections of source code 

 

**Source Code** - Any collection of code that is displayed in a human readable format. Source code can be sent to a compiler to be translated into machine code for the CPU to utilize. 

 

**Open source** - A project or repository that anyone can request to make changes or updates to. This is a good way to learn. 

 
**Pseudocode** - A human-readable explanation of how something should work ‚Äì the way and order that it runs in. Pseudocode does not have to follow the rules of any programming language. It is a description of what the code in a program is doing so that even non-technical individuals can understand its logic. 

 

**Scrum/Agile** - Methodical frameworks for organizing, developing, delivering and maintaining software. Scrum and Agile disciplines can be applied to a wide variety of fields but has been a popular choice in software development due to its effective approach to handling very complex tasks. 

 
**Machine Learning** - A realm of study within the domain of artificial intelligence that aims to develop techniques in software which allow machines to learn through experience. 
 

**Transpile** - The process of turning code from one language into another. Examples include: TypeScript transpiled into JavaScript, CoffeeScript transpiled into JavaScript, Earl Grey being transpiled into JavaScript, JavaScript being transpiled into JavaScript. You‚Äôll notice a trend.
